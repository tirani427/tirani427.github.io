                <p>Hello! My name is Tia Irani.</p>
                <p>I'm a rising fourth-year undergraduate at UC San Diego pursuing a B.S in Computer Science. I'm a first-generation immigrant to the United States, and I've lived in California for nearly fifteen years now. I began programming in fifth grade when I participated in the "Girls in Tech" summer program at eBay for two consecutive years.</p>

                <p>I furthered my interest in computer science by enrolling in the Computer Science Academy at Christopher High School, a four-year track where I was taught Java and Python, how to program a small robot to navigate a course, and was first introduced to cybersecurity standards and protective procedures. I enjoy working on team-based projects, and I enjoy reading books about different facets of the subject in order to gain new perspectives and ways to learn.</p>
